# Read this first
This is an ongoing process for High Level System Architecture of PharmaRx. Changes to the design may be implemented in the future. I will try to keep this document up to date with the latest changes and provide links to the editable file where possible. I recommend using excalidraw and draw.io for creating your own high level diagrams. Links are down below.
